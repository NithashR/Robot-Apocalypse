The game requires a VR headset, two sensors and two controllers to run. During the setup of the
headset, the sensors were 5ft apart. This is roughly the same size as the standing spot in the game. The
input devices are the controllers. The trigger, grip, x/a and b/y are being used for the game. The camera
requires no abnormal setup, just the normal way work with the game.
